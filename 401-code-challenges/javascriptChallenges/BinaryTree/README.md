# Binary Tree
THis challenge was to utilize linked lists. The explanation for linked lists was hard to understand, but once I logged a linked list that was 3 nodes long, I saw that it wasnt a chain of nodes but more a "russian nesting doll" chain of nodes. The head of the list, has the "next" box inside its own node. NOT outside.

## Challenge
Class 16 Tests: findMaximumValue()
  npm test binary-tree.test.js

## Approach & Efficiency
Wanted to make sure I traversed the tree hitting all the values, and while doing so, I searched the values comparing it to the "max" value.
