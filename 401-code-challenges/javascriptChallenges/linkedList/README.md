# Singly Linked List
THis challenge was to utilize linked lists. The explanation for linked lists was hard to understand, but once I logged a linked list that was 3 nodes long, I saw that it wasnt a chain of nodes but more a "russian nesting doll" chain of nodes. The head of the list, has the "next" box inside its own node. NOT outside.

## Challenge
Class 6 Tests: Append, InsertBefore, InsertAfter

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->


## WhiteBoard
I'm still not too familiar with what the whiteboard is supposed to signify but I drew what I was working on to help understand what the nodes were doing.
