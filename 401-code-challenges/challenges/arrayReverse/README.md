#### Array Reverse

# Reverse an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
Simple function to reverse the order of an array. Very simple. I used push because I couldnt think of any other way to send an int to an array

## Approach & Efficiency
Pretty straight forward approach. The assignment asked for a simple function and used repl to test it.
