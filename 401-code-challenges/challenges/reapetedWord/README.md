# Repeated Word
THis challenge was to utilize linked lists. The explanation for linked lists was hard to understand, but once I logged a linked list that was 3 nodes long, I saw that it wasnt a chain of nodes but more a "russian nesting doll" chain of nodes. The head of the list, has the "next" box inside its own node. NOT outside.

## Challenge
Class 31 Tests: repeatedWord()
  npm test repeatedWord.test.js

## Approach & Efficiency
To loops happen. We use the first loop to store the value to be passed into the second loop to compare to the rest of the words.
