# Singly Linked List
THis challenge was to utilize linked lists. The explanation for linked lists was hard to understand, but once I logged a linked list that was 3 nodes long, I saw that it wasnt a chain of nodes but more a "russian nesting doll" chain of nodes. The head of the list, has the "next" box inside its own node. NOT outside.
